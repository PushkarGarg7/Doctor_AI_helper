Elevated Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW),A measure of the variation in red blood cell size.,An increased RDW has been associated with poor prognosis in lung cancer patients.
Elevated Red Blood Cell (RBC) Count (Polycythemia),An increase in the number of red blood cells.,"In advanced emphysema, chronic hypoxemia (low blood oxygen levels) can stimulate the body to produce more red blood cells to enhance oxygen transport."
Elevated Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW),A measure of the variation in red blood cell size.,Higher RDW levels have been associated with increased disease severity and lower survival rates in COPD patients.
Altered Hemoglobin Levels,Hemoglobin is the protein in red blood cells responsible for oxygen transport.,Chronic hypoxemia in emphysema can lead to elevated hemoglobin levels as a compensatory mechanism to improve oxygen delivery.
Elevated White Blood Cell (WBC) Count (Leukocytosis),"An increased number of white blood cells, typically indicating an immune response.","Elevated WBC counts, particularly high neutrophil counts, have been associated with a higher incidence of acute exacerbations in COPD patients."
Elevated Eosinophil Count,"A higher number of eosinophils, a type of white blood cell involved in allergic responses and asthma.","Raised blood eosinophil levels are associated with higher eosinophil levels in the lungs, which is a biomarker of type 2 inflammatory activity in the airway."
Elevated White Blood Cell (WBC) Count (Leukocytosis),"An increased number of white blood cells, typically indicating an inflammatory or immune response.","Elevated WBC counts have been identified as strong and independent predictors of coronary heart disease, which can lead to conditions resulting in cardiomegaly."
Anemia (Low Hemoglobin and Hematocrit Levels),"A condition characterized by a decrease in red blood cells or hemoglobin, leading to reduced oxygen transport.","Anemia can cause the heart to work harder to supply oxygen to tissues, potentially leading to heart enlargement over time."
Elevated Platelet Count (Thrombocytosis),An increased number of platelets in the blood.,Higher platelet counts are more suitable for exudate-type effusions.
Elevated Neutrophil Count (Neutrophilia),"An increased number of neutrophils, a type of white blood cell.",Higher neutrophil counts are more suitable for exudate-type effusions.
Elevated Lymphocyte Count (Lymphocytosis),"An increased number of lymphocytes, a type of white blood cell.",Higher lymphocyte counts are more suitable for exudate-type effusions.
Elevated Mean Platelet Volume (MPV),A measure of the average size of platelets.,High MPV values are suitable for transudate-effusion types.
Elevated Red Cell Distribution Width (RDW),A measure of the variation in red blood cell size.,High RDW values are suitable for transudate-effusion types.
Thrombocytopenia (Low Platelet Count),A reduced number of platelets in the blood.,"Liver fibrosis can lead to portal hypertension, causing spleen enlargement and increased platelet sequestration, resulting in thrombocytopenia."
Neutrophil-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (NLR),The ratio of neutrophils to lymphocytes in the blood.,Elevated NLR has been associated with increased inflammation and disease severity in idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) patients.
Platelet-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (PLR),The ratio of platelets to lymphocytes in the blood.,Increased PLR has been linked to systemic inflammation and worse prognosis in IPF patients.
Monocyte-to-Lymphocyte Ratio (MLR),The ratio of monocytes to lymphocytes in the blood.,Higher MLR values have been associated with disease severity and progression in IPF.
Systemic Inflammation Response Index (SIRI),"An index combining neutrophil, monocyte, and lymphocyte counts to assess systemic inflammation.",Elevated SIRI levels have been linked to increased inflammation and poorer outcomes in IPF patients.
Aggregate Index of Systemic Inflammation (AISI),"A composite index incorporating neutrophil, monocyte, lymphocyte, and platelet counts to evaluate systemic inflammation.",Higher AISI values have been associated with increased disease severity in IPF.
Anemia (Low Hemoglobin/Hematocrit),Reduced oxygen-carrying capacity of blood.,"Can reduce oncotic pressure, leading to fluid leakage into tissues (edema)."
Leukocytosis (High WBC Count),"Increased white blood cells, usually due to infection or inflammation.",Indicates inflammatory or infectious processes that may cause fluid retention.
Thrombocytosis (High Platelet Count),Increased platelet production.,"Can be linked to inflammatory conditions, increasing vascular permeability and edema."
Thrombocytopenia (Low Platelet Count),Reduced platelet levels.,May be associated with conditions that cause vascular leakage and swelling.
Elevated Hematocrit & RBC Count,Increased concentration of red blood cells.,Can indicate dehydration-related edema or chronic hypoxia-related fluid retention.
Elevated Mean Corpuscular Volume (MCV),Larger than normal red blood cells.,"Can be associated with anemia or liver disease, both of which contribute to edema."
Elevated White Blood Cell (WBC) Count (Leukocytosis),"An increase in the number of white blood cells, typically indicating an immune response to infection.",Leukocytosis is commonly observed in bacterial pneumonia as the body mounts a defense against the invading pathogens.
Neutrophilia,"An increase in neutrophils, a subtype of white blood cells crucial for combating bacterial infections.","Bacterial pneumonia often leads to neutrophilia, reflecting the body's targeted response to bacterial pathogens."
Lymphopenia,"A decrease in lymphocytes, another subtype of white blood cells involved in immune responses.","Viral pneumonia may present with lymphopenia, indicating a viral etiology."
Anemia,"A condition characterized by a decrease in red blood cells or hemoglobin, leading to reduced oxygen transport.","Anemia can complicate pneumonia by impairing oxygen delivery to tissues, exacerbating respiratory distress."
Thrombocytosis,An elevated platelet count in the blood.,"Thrombocytosis can occur as a reactive process in response to infection and inflammation, including pneumonia."
Thrombocytopenia,A lower than normal platelet count.,"Thrombocytopenia may be observed in severe cases of pneumonia, particularly when associated with sepsis or disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)."
Neutropenia,A decrease in neutrophil count.,"Neutropenia can increase susceptibility to infections, including pneumonia, especially in immunocompromised individuals."
